## Hello! I'm Nathan 

I'm a data scientist & programmer interested in economic and international relations topics. This website hosts all my data visualizations, web applications, and posts on subjects of personal interest.

### Some more about me...

I'm a math undergrad, currently living in Florida. In the future, I hope to pursue a graduate degree in statistics, hopefully with a focus in economics and/or politics, as those are my two biggest passions (along with history). 

My ultimate goal is to create a news site that examines less discussed topics in the media, dividing issues into comprehensive series of articles, focusing on quality over quantity, attacking subjects from a data driven perspective, and developing worthwhile applications that would assist these goals. All of these are very lofty goals, but I'd like to think this blog is loosely related to achieving them.

Other hobbies I'm interested in are music, where I've been playing drums on and off for about 10 years. I also love reading, unsurprisingly about history, politics, philosophy, etc.
