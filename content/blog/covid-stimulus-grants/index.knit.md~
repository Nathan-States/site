## Background 



## Grants to Airlines <U+2708><U+FE0F> <U+FE0F> 

Among the aspects that stick out right away from a preliminary glance at the data are award amounts to airlines. In total, airline companies received \$42 billion in grants, second most behind healthcare services, and all except two part of the Payroll Support Program (PSP). Note that this total does **not** include an additional \$18 billion that was given as part of the Airport Rescue and Airport Grant programs. 

According to the [Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assisting-american-industry/payroll-support-program-payments): 

> Funds received by [PSP] must exclusively be used for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries, and benefits. 

There were three separate PSP programs, with the government handing out payments over the course of year from 2020/20/04 - 2021/22/04 (not including a single payment for \$300,000 that was given in 2022 for some reason). According to the Treasury, "PSP1 provided assistance to over **600** companies, supporting *hundreds of thousands* of aviation jobs." As CEO of American Airlines Doug Parker stated in [December 2021](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-airlines-defend-54-billion-covid-19-government-lifeline-2021-12-15/), "It's not an exaggeration to say the program saved the airline industry." 

However, the extent to which the Payroll Support Program accomplished this remains debatable, including whether airlines were deserving of such generous funds in the first place. 

#### Quick Sidenotes 

While not all data was available in the previous section, it *is* for this section. Therefore, these are **conclusive** amounts.

As part of PSP, airlines had to pay back 26.2% of the total amount rewarded to them. These are considered loans, and are therefore not included in the data, but it should be noted that the total amount airlines received in sum is \$54 billion+. 

### Biggest Beneficiaries  

The treasury says they've assisted over 600 different airlines, but how were those funds distributed among them?
