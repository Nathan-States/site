### The "World's Worst Huamnitarian Crisis"

For nearly eight years, tens of millions of Yemeni civilians have endured the brutal hardships of a war that the [United Nations](https://www.unfpa.org/yemen) has consistently referred to as the "world's largest humanitarian crisis." In recent years, COVID-19 has caused the country's few isolation centers to become overcrowded, and a recent surge in airstrikes from Saudi Arabia during early 2022 [led some](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423) to speculate that the conflict was become even more violent. A string of two month [peace deals](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/saudi-arabia-yemen-war-truce-peace-agreement-leads-will) - some not negotiated until the very last days the ceasefire ended - has currently kept the countries at bay. However, [widespread famine](https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/yemen-emergency), an impending [water crisis](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/water-situation-yemen), and the devastation left as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in 2015 has left the country of nearly 30 million on the brink of peril. 

Despite this, Yemen has received almost little, if any, media exposure. Data gathered by *[The New Humanitarian](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2016/02/11/why-does-no-one-care-about-yemen)* via GDELT shows that the number of online articles concerning Yemen following the "Saudi-led intervention" in 2015 were consistently below 1%, with even Arabic news agencies scarcely giving the conflict attention. The *Guardian* recently referred to the conflict as the "forgotten war." *Salon* mocked the lack of coverage by MSNBC, pointing out that the network had done 455 articles in 2018 on Stormy Daniels - the porn-star Donald Trump paid off to stay silent using campaign contributions - and **0** on Yemen. Put another way, the Stormy Daniels story was awarded infinite more coverage in 2018 by MSNBC than the United States [involvement](https://www.justsecurity.org/80806/still-at-war-the-united-states-in-yemen/) in the the world's largest humanitarian crisis, which was ongoing throughout the Trump presidency. 

Yemen has been one of the poorest countries in the world since the 1990s, which has significantly exacerbated the number of deaths caused by the war. In fact, a [UNDP report](https://www.undp.org/publications/assessing-impact-war-yemen-pathways-recovery) predicted that by the end of 2021, as many as 377,000 Yemeni will have perished from the conflict, 60 percent of them dead from indirect causes, such as lack of access to food, water, and healthcare. Aid initiatives launched by the United Nations have often [missed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-united-nations-aid.html) their goal numbers, and the aid that is given is often mismanaged, wasted, or given to corrupt officials. 

In terms of lack of funding, Yemen's case is hardly. The Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian organization, recently discussed on *[NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/03/04/1084230259/not-every-war-gets-the-same-coverage-as-russias-invasion-and-that-has-consequenc)* how the organization "expects to surpass with Ukraine what we raised in its entirety for the Haiti 2021 earthquake," a total amount of \$2.5 million. The Mercy Corps had begun fundraising for Ukraine for less than a *week*.
 
Even if aid and donation initiatives were met, it would only mitigate the catastrophic state of the country. UN officials have warned that Yemen will "[fall off the cliff](https://www.unocha.org/story/un-humanitarian-chief-yemen-will-%E2%80%98fall-cliff%E2%80%99-without-adequate-support-humanitarian-and-covid)" without enough humanitarian aid. Interestingly, while the United State are the ones supplying the bombs to Saudi Arabia, they *also* provide aid to Yemen. 

Although the United States has given at *least* **[$54.6 billion](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105988)** (there's no exact number, apparently) in military aid to the United Arab Emirates (another country involved in the war) and Saudi Arabia, they've also given *\$4.5 billion* in aid to Yemen since 2015. Similarly, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have also recently [pledged humanitarian aid](https://www.state.gov/welcoming-saudi-arabia-and-the-uaes-economic-and-humanitarian-support-for-yemen/) to Yemen, even though Saudi Arabia's naval blockade has  [repeatably](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/middleeast/yemen-famine-saudi-fuel-intl/index.html) [been](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/14/deadly-consequences/obstruction-aid-yemen-during-covid-19) [accused](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-blockade.html) of blocking humanitarian aid ships from coming to Yemen. To quote the president of the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation, a charity that provides relief aid to those affected in Yemen;

> " The Saudi imposed blockade is the main contributor to the spread of starvation and diseases[...]"
> - Alish Jumaan, Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation

Put generously, it's hard not to see these actions as contradictions. 

With the overall lack of media coverage, it can be hard to assess and understand the Yemen conflict. This is unfortunate, because there are some amazing data projects that have been created in regards to the war, such as *[Yemen Data Project](https://yemendataproject.org/)* and the *[Yemen Archives](https://yemeniarchive.org/)*. In the future, I want to use the data from these sources to hopefully provide a more detailed breakdown of the war in Yemen. 

Before doing so, I want to give a simple, comprehensive, and concise explanation of how this war started. 

<br><br>

## A Tribal Society  

Yemen is located at the southern most part of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering the Red Sea on its west, the Arabian Sea to its south, Oman on the east, and Saudi Arabia to the north. The capital Sana'a has a population of around 2.5 million, and is home to the social and political elites of the country. Around 70% - 75% of Yemeni are part of "tribes," which are largely based on family bloodlines, with some going back hundreds of years.  

The term "tribes" often has a negative connotation attached to it, and usually evokes images of an uncivilized, simplistic, and primitive group of people. On the contrary, tribes are quite complex. Many of them have their own dialect, laws, courts, jails, hospitals, record keepers, and tax systems. Tribes will often partner with other tribes, forming *clans*. Some have friendly relations with the Yemeni government, especially those with ties to rich business industries, but most tribes have historically been at odds with the Yemeni state. 

, what's important is to understand how they *function* in society, which could be more accurately described as quasi-governmental institutions who interact and collaborate with other tribes, and have historically had. Many tribes have their own laws, hospitals, courts, jails, record keepers, and tax systems. Some tribes cooperate to advance common goals, while others will try to win greater influence through local politics, family ties, and occasionally, violence. 

If you'd like a more thorough breakdown, I'd recommend reading *A Tribal Order* by Shelagh Weir, which you can find [here](https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Order-Politics-Mountains-Modern/dp/0292714238). What's crucial to understand is that tribes are generally the driving force behind society in Yemen, which is important to understanding the country from a historical perspective. 

## Colonial Aden

Along with India, Hong Kong, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, Pakistan, Nigeria, and a long list of other countries/territories that later became countries, Yemen was also home to a British Colony in the *Aden Protectorate*. **Aden** is a port city on the very south of the country, linking the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea together. Before 1937, Aden had been part of larger British India before the *Government of India Act, 1935*, resulted in the territory becoming a separate Crown colony. 

During the 1940s and 1950s, Aden would become one of the busiest ports in the world, peaking at second in ___ - only behind New York City. Like all British colonies, this came with a poor, underprivileged, and overworked labor force who, when exports began reaching record numbers, were worked to the bone. 

In response, trade unions and labor movements began forming. 

The map of the Middle East looks a lot different than it does today.

## Yemen at War and Egypt's Vietnam

## Socialist South Yemen 

Renamed to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) in 1970, South Yemen became the first and only socialist country in the history of the Middle East, with a population of around 2 million. Its new leaders were immediately faced with economic hardship. The destruction left by the war, most notably the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967, made Aden's port essentially worthless. Colonies tend to leave most land underdeveloped, preferring to hyper-exploit certain areas while leaving others untouched, meaning most of South Yemen lacked industrial resources. 

The economic policies of the PDRY could hardly be described as "communist," but they did make some important changes that ensured basic living standards for its citizens. The PDRY guaranteed employment to rural citizens, developed a strong medical infrastructure, and created a comprehensive, free education system. 

Women rights in South Yemen flourished and were widely considered the best in the region at that time. Women were encouraged to pursue education and work in public. Polygamy, child marriages, and adultery were all made illegal by the 1974 Family Law. Headscarves were not mandatory, and women were allowed to dress as they wished. The General Union of Yemeni Women provided literacy courses and training to women, and promoted the idea that women "should be encouraged to participate fully and equally in society." 

Though the economy and women rights saw notable improvements in the PDRY, the leadership remained extremely unstable. In October 1977, president Ibrahim al-Hamdi of North Yemen was assassinated, two days before he was supposed to visit South Yemen to negotiate unification of the two countries. To this day, no one is sure who killed him, though [some](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/3/26/yemenis-still-want-answers-about-ibrahim-al-hamdis-assassination) suspect Saudi Arabia supported the killing. Regardless, officer Ahmad al-Ghashmi would assume presidency - but he was assassinated nine months later, supposedly by orders of Salim Rubai Ali (more commonly known as *Salmine*) who was then the president of the PDRY. However, like the death of al-Hamdi, no one knows for sure who pulled the trigger. 

Regardless, the same month in June 1978, southern leaders would take the opportunity to murder Salmine, making Abdul Fattah Ismail the new president of the PDRY. *Ismail*

## The North Yemen Republic 



### Dancing On the Heads of Snakes

There's an infamous quote attributed to Saleh that is worth bringing up. 

> "Ruling Yemen is hard. I always say it's like *dancing on the heads of snakes*." 

Worth interprets this line as Saleh attempting to "convey a kingly gravitas," which may be the case, but I think a more straightforward reading is more illuminating in terms of understanding what he means. As one Yemeni analyst puts it;

> "Saleh rules through proxies, using the *TAPE B* formula to control traditional and emerging social forces. That’s;
* **T** for the tribes, 
* **A** for the army, 
* **P** for political parties, 
* **E** for extremists and 
* **B** for the business families."

*Dancing on the heads of snakes* is better understood as a simile for describing the complexities of navigating power within these proxies, something Saleh was able to perform remarkably well. Saleh was propped up and supported by wealthy businesses, rich investors, and the elites of Yemen, protecting their interests through an Army that largely remained loyal to Saleh through his reign of power, pitting powerful tribes and political enemies against each other to squash potential uprisings, sometimes even using extremists to accomplish these goals, and all while getting [considerably rich](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/2/25/un-says-ex-yemen-president-saleh-stole-up-to-60bn).  

## "Unification" and Reality 

With the fall of Communism in 1989, South Yemen would lose its major 


## Houthi Insurgency 

The governorate *Saada*, bordering Saudi Arabia in the northern highlands of Yemen,  was one of the last regions to be incorporated into the 1990 reunification of Yemen, and remained one of the poorest of the region. About 35% - 40% of Yemeni are *Zaidis*, a branch of Shi'i Islam practiced by a very small subset of the global Shi'i community. Along with southern separatists, they were one of the groups that were routinely persecuted by the Saleh regime. Many Zaidis belong to Saada and their neighboring regions, though they exist in other governorates as well. 

During the early 1990s, either Mohammed or Hussein al-Houthi of the **Houthi tribe** created the *Believing Youth* organization. The organization sought to "promote a Zaidi revival" in Saada by creating school clubs and summer camps, which enrolled some 15,000 - 20,000 Yemeni children . While the group was originally tolerated by Saleh, mostly to counter Saudi influence in the area, *Believing Youth* began accusing the Yemeni government of economic marginalization, discrimination, and for Yemen's cooperation with the United States during the *War on Terror*. This eventually made the Houthis a threat in the eyes of the Saleh regime. 

There's a severe lack of information on the Saada region during the early 2000s. Some analysts suggest that the region was mostly ruled by local authorities after reunification, with the central government having little to no control over the region, but it isn't clear who exactly ruled the area. It also isn't clear how much support the Houthis had, nor what their relations were like with the tribes of Saada. 

With that said, based on what is known, after Saleh signed the *Treaty of Jeddah* in 2000, which resolved some longstanding border disputes with Saudi Arabia, he actively sought to disarm the Houthis, who by this point, had adopted the usage of their formal name *Ansar Allah*, which literally means "followers of God." 

According to dispatches originally leaked by *Wikileaks* back in 2010, the United States had given Saleh \$160 million 



## 2011 Revolution 



## Failures of National Dialogue 



## September Revolution / Coup d'état

Throughout the National Dialogue Conference, small clashes between Ansar Allah and their opposition (primarily al-Islah and military forces loyal to Saleh) would leave hundreds dead, especially in Hajjah region. The Houthis would slowly but surely consolidate control over their neighboring regions, expanding their influence. 

To many Yemeni, the "progress" made by the NDC was seen as failing, and the actions taken by Hadi at the advice of the UN were increasingly becoming unpopular. 

The most significant action taken happened on July 30th, 2014. In an attempt to obtain a \$560 loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Hadi-led government announced a cut to fuel subsidies, which nearly doubled the cost of fuel prices. While subsidies largely benefited the economic elites, fuel was also one of the few goods that provided the poor with transportation, food, water, and the means to survival. The decision to announce these cuts during Eid al-Fitr (holiday marking the end of Ramadan) by posting a price sheet in Sana'a - during when most of the residents had left for celebration - was widely seen as cowardice and an acknowledgement of the move's unpopularity. 

Protests would soon become widespread, many of them led and organized under Ansar Allah. On [August 22nd](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-protests-idUSKBN0GM12C20140822), tens of thousands assembled at the capital of Sana'a, calling on Hadi to reverse the subsidy cut. Hadi did not. 

During the following weeks, Ansar Allah and Al-Islah would continue fighting, with the Houthis consolidating control over the capital. On September 21st - the day the Houthis took defacto control over the capital - the Yemeni Army refused to intervene, instead declaring their "support for the people's revolution." Later that same day, a UN-brokered deal agreed to form a "unity government" between opposing sides in an attempt to stop the violence, but fighting would continue. Ansar Allah, though, had established significant control of Yemen, and could now use the capital as political leverage, in essence, marking the beginning of the end for the Hadi government.  

Given the relative ease at which the Houthis were able to capture the capital, many suspected Saleh had assisted them by telling his largely loyal military to not intervene. Indeed, an eventual report by the [UN Security Council](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2015_125.pdf) found that Saleh had "ordered his supporters in the government, the security services, and the tribes not to intervene and curb Houthi forces in the achievements of their goals." 

You'll notice I deliberately titled this section both as a "revolution" and a "coup d'état" to highlight the impact word choice has on describing events. Revolutions are typically depicted as democratic struggles, popular uprisings, generally against the rule of an oppressive regime. Coups, on the other hand, are usually thought of as bloody, violent government overthrows, have questionable or low levels of popular support, usually spearheaded by military forces, and usually pursued for personal gain. 

Whether the events that culminated in the overthrow of Hadi are more accurately described as a "revolution" or "coup d'état" is a matter of debate, and it would be far too simplistic to simply say "it's somewhere in the middle." The important question is how much support Ansar Allah actually has among the general population, which is almost entirely unknown.  

### Hadi's Resignation 

As fighting continued, the "unity government" led by Hadi and Ansar Allah attempted to make concessions. Still, fighting continued. 

On November 7th, the [UN](uk.reuters.com/article/uk-yemen-un-sanctions-idUKKBN0IR2EC20141107) placed sanctions on Saleh and two Houthi commanders for their roles in overtaking Sana'a. Saleh accused Hadi of instigating the sanctions, and subsequently kicked him out of the General People's Congress. 

Two days later, the new government was sworn in. The Houthis and the GPC did not participate. During the next two months, the Houthis would begin using various threats against the new government and their supporters, causing then Prime Minister to declare that the new government was ready to "[withdraw if the other party was willing to shoulder the responsibility](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-houthis-idUSKBN0JV1DP20141217)." 

From January 18 - 21, Houthis and Hadi's forces would clash at his residence, leaving hundreds of dead. On [January 22nd, 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aden-ports-reopened-but-rebels-still-outside-presidential-palace-and-residence/2015/01/22/d3563d88-a1ba-11e4-91fc-7dff95a14458_story.html), Hadi and the new government officially resigned. 

## Operation Decisive Storm 

A power void had officially opened up in Yemen, and over the next two months, a cluster of chaotic moves would drive the country into further instability. 

Hadi and the new government were immediately placed under house arrest. 

The Houthis would officially dissolve the new government on [February 6th, 2015](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/02/06/384292512/yemens-houthi-rebels-dissolve-parliament-seize-power), creating their own political body named the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, but this was not officially recognized by the international community. 

Protests against the Houthis raged in several governorates, and a small group of) [southerners](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-fragmentation-analysis-idUSKBN0KY0BR20150125) informally announced their secession from Yemen, though this lacked the support of the entire region. Still, the Houthis maintained large control of the country. 

On [Febuary 24th](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/2/24/yemens-ousted-president-withdraws-resignation), Hadi escaped house arrest and fled to his hometown in Aden, declaring it the new capital. There, he officially rescinded his resignation, declaring all decisions made by Ansar Allah illegitimate, and called on the Gulf States for assistance. 

Afterwards, Ansar Allah declared their intentions at driving Hadi's forces out of the country, beginning the Southern Offensive. On March 25th, with Houthi forces closing in on Aden, Hadi was forced to flee by [boat](https://www.businessinsider.com/officials-yemens-president-just-fled-the-country-on-a-boat-2015-3). At this point, Saudi Arabia had began an [airstrike](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/26/Saudi-airstrikes-yemen.html) campaign against the Houthis, which they nicknamed **Operation Decisive Storm**, which had both the approval of the GCC and United States, the latter of whom approved and provided [logistical and intelligence support](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/25/statement-nsc-spokesperson-bernadette-meehan-situation-yemen) to.

On March 26th, Hadi arrived at Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, where he met with Saudi Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman, more commonly referred to as MBS. 

At an Arab Summit meeting that concluded on March 29th, an agreement was made between the attending countries to assemble a military force with the specific aims of reinstating Hadi as president of Yemen. While Saudi Arabia led the initiative, it was supported in large part by the United Arab Emirates and the United States, as well as Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Senegal, the United Kingdom, Germany, and at times, Sudan, Qatar, Morocco, mercenaries from Academi, Saudi-paid Yemeni mercenaries, and [allegedly](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/8/6/report-saudi-uae-coalition-cut-deals-with-al-qaeda-in-yemen) parts of Al-Qaeda (the United States denies this). 

### Iranian Influence? 

So far, I've gone through this entire post without once mentioning Iran's influence on Ansar Allah. This may come as a surprise to those more familiar with the conflict. The few times that Yemen is mentioned in the media, Ansar Allah is consistently referred to as "Iranian-backed Houthi rebels," the "Iran-aligned Houthis," or "Iranian-supported Houthis." Some commentators have accused the Houthis of being "[Iranian proxies](https://www.csis.org/analysis/iranian-and-houthi-war-against-saudi-arabia)," or that Iran is involved in a proxy war against Saudi Arabia. [*Foreign Policy*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/24/yemen-houthi-uae-israel-iran-abraham-accords/) has recently accused Iran of using the Houthis to battle Israel in a "proxy war." 

These incredibly serious and important accusations deserve a much more thorough analysis, but to summarize these accusations succinctly, I contest that these characterizations are - on the whole - massively overstated. 

To start, note that the accusations of the Houthi tribe being backed by Iran goes all the way back to the 1990s, when Saleh still ruled over the country. At that time, he did not explicitly charge they were backed by Iran, instead claiming they had "sympathies" towards the country. Saleh would repeatably point out that they were Shia - the same Islamic sect as Iran - though the Houthis are more accurately described as Zaydi, one of the branches of Shia. 

This allegation would later morph into claims that Hezbollah they were being trained by Hezbollah, a political party and militant group based in Lebanon, and a group funded by Iran. By the 2000s, the direct accusations Iran was funding the Houthis were beginning to be made, in combination with their Hezbollah ties. 

There was no one who Saleh wanted to convince more of the Houthi-Iranian ties than the United States, who gave the Saleh led government a total of [\$160 million](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/operation-scorched-earth-a-us-hand-in-yemen-s-civil-war-a-732734.html) from 2002-2009. The US made an additional promise of \$150 million for 2010 alone. Saudi Arabia, who actually fought the Houthis during their fifth clash in 2009 (dubbed Operation Scorch Earth by the Yemeni government), pledged an additional \$62 million in 2009. 

From dispatches made public by *Wikileaks* in 2010, we can see what the United States thought about the alleged Iranian ties to the Houthis. 

> "It is the embassy's firm belief that if Yemen had any concrete evidence that the Houthis had nonnections to either Hezbollah or Iran, it would have produced it immediately; the lack of such evidence likely indicates that the Yemeni government lacks any real proof of such links." 

The dispatch concludes stating that Iran's influence "is limited to informal religious ties between Yemeni and Iranian scholars and negligible Iranian investment in the energy and development sectors." 

On October 25, 2009, the Yemeni government reported it had seized the *Mahan 1*, with a crew of five Iranians, including weapons on board headed to the Houthi rebels. Once again, let's see what Washington thought of this claim. 

> "Most recently, the Yemeni government has failed to substantiate its extravagant, public claims that an Iranian ship seized in the Red Sea off its coast on Oct. 25 was carrying Iranian military trainers, weapons and explosives destined for the Houthis. In fact, sensitive reporting suggests that the ship was carrying no weapons at all." 

Interestingly, a [2015 report](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2015_401.pdf) by the UN Security Council refers to the *Mahan 1* as evidence of Iran supporting the Houthis, either oblivious to the fact the US had clearly disagreed with those findings, didn't care, or had a change of mind an entire five years later. 

[Another dispatch reads](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANAA2186_a.html):

> "Contrary to ROYG (the Yemeni government) claims that Iran is arming the Houthis, most analysts report that the Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG military itself."

There are two obvious facts that need to be explicitly stated here. The claims that Iran is backing the Houthis clearly held political weight for Saleh, who stood to benefit from Western funds, and who literally repurposed those funds to fight against the Houthis. Secondly, it *still* holds political weight, as painting the Houthis as being backed by Iran provides a massive justification to the current war that may otherwise lack such rationalization. 

Even so, those dispatches were from 2010. They say nothing about 

Referring back to the UN report, they mention several other ships confiscated, but all rely on the testimonies of Yemeni authorities, who, given previous dispatches, should be taken at face value. More importantly, there is a three year gap between 2012-2015, where the UN reports that **zero** ships were confiscated. Recall that in 2014, Ansar Allah marched on Sana'a and took control of the capital. Apparently, this action was taken without Iran arming them once for over two years, or at the very least, no ships were confiscated. 

Still, a December 2014 [article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-houthis-iran-insight/iranian-support-seen-crucial-for-yemens-houthis-idUSKBN0JT17A20141215) by *Reuters* reiterates these claims. *Reuters* acknowledges that the claims made by Western, Yemeni, and even Iranian officials could not be verified - but evidence is provided in the form of "Jihan 1." 

Jihan 1 was a ship confiscated by a joint patrol of the US Navy and Yemeni Coast Guard that contained a stash of weapons, including 122-millimeter rockets, RPG-7s, C-4 explosives, surface-to-air missiles, and much more. A later UN inspection said the weaponry had labels stuck to them saying "Ministry of Sepah" - a former Iranian agency responsible for military logistical supply. The UN concluded that "all avaliable information placed the Islamic Republic of Iran at the centre of the Jihan operation" - and Yemeni and US officials claimed that the ship was headed to the Houthis. 

However, outside of those labels, the UN provided no additional evidence proving the ship belonged to Iran. One would have to seriously question

### TL:DR
