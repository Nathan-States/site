Thank you to:

* [Allison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/), for creating the [Hugo Apéro](https://github.com/hugo-apero) theme, which works extremely well in combination with `blogdown`. 
* [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://github.com/gadenbuie), whose custom panelsets and layouts for the Hugo Apéro theme I used in the creation of this site. 

**Note**: I have no personal affiliation with the people listed above.
